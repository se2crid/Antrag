A modern SwiftUI app to manage iOS/iPadOS applications on stock devices. This app uses [idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice) and lockdownd pairing to retrieve and manage installed apps.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Modern SwiftUI Interface** - Built with SwiftUI for iOS 16+ design guidelines and Liquid Glass compatibility
- **Smart App Listing** - View both System and User apps with beautiful app icons
- **Advanced Search** - Real-time search with iOS 16+ native search experience
- **Mass Operations** - Select and delete multiple apps at once
- **App Management** - Delete, open, and view detailed app information
- **Clean Settings** - Streamlined settings with useful options only
- **Auto-refresh** - Configurable automatic app list refreshing
- **Native iOS Experience** - Context menus, sheets, and modern iOS interactions

### Development Builds
Unsigned IPA files are automatically built and released for each commit to the main branch. Check the [Releases](https://github.com/khcrysalis/antrag/releases) page for the latest development builds.

## How does it work?

- Establish a heartbeat with a TCP provider (the app will need this for later).
  - For it to be successful, we need a pairing file from [JitterbugPair](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases) and a [VPN](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051).
- When preparing the list, we need to establish another connection but for `installation_proxy` using our heartbeat provider and client handle.
- Then we can use `installation_proxy_get_apps` using that handle to list applications.

Due to how it works right now we need both a VPN and a lockdownd pairing file, this means you will need a computer for its initial setup.

## Building

#### Minimum requirements

- Xcode 16
- Swift 5.9
- iOS 16

1. Clone repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/khcrysalis/Antrag
    ```

2. Compile
    ```sh
    cd Antrag
    gmake
    ```

3. Updating
    ```sh
    git pull
    ```

## ðŸ”§ Development

This project has been migrated from UIKit to SwiftUI for better performance, maintainability, and modern iOS compatibility.

### Building

The project uses a Makefile for automated building and packaging:

```bash
# Clean and build unsigned IPA
make clean && make

# The IPA will be available in packages/Antrag.ipa
```

Using the makefile will automatically create an adhoc ipa inside the packages directory. For development and debugging, it's recommended to use Xcode directly.

### GitHub Actions

The project includes automated CI/CD that:
- Builds unsigned IPAs on every push to main/ui-update branches
- Creates automatic releases for main branch commits
- Caches build dependencies for faster builds
- Includes build metadata and file size information

### Architecture

- **SwiftUI** - Modern declarative UI framework
- **MVVM Pattern** - Clean separation of concerns with ViewModels
- **Async/Await** - Modern concurrency for network operations
- **idevice** - Backend framework for iOS device communication
