An app to list iOS/iPadOS app's, for stock devices. This app uses [idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice) and lockdownd pairing to retrieve installed apps.

### Features

- List "System" & "User" apps
- Basic filtering

## Download

Visit [releases](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Antrag/releases) and get the latest `.ipa`.

## How does it work?

- Establish a heartbeat with a TCP provider (the app will need this for later).
  - For it to be successful, we need a pairing file from [JitterbugPair](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases) and a [VPN](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051).
- When preparing the list, we need to establish another connection but for `installation_proxy` using our heartbeat provider and client handle.
- Then we can use `installation_proxy_get_apps` using that handle to list applications.

Due to how it works right now we need both a VPN and a lockdownd pairing file, this means you will need a computer for its initial setup.

## Building

#### Minimum requirements

- Xcode 16
- Swift 5.9
- iOS 16

1. Clone repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/khcrysalis/Antrag
    ```

2. Compile
    ```sh
    cd Antrag
    gmake
    ```

3. Updating
    ```sh
    git pull
    ```

Using the makefile will automatically create an adhoc ipa inside the packages directory, using this to debug or report issues is not recommend. When making a pull request or reporting issues, it's generally advised you've used Xcode to debug your changes properly.
